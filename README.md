# Gobang-Game-Gased-on-Static-Rules

This is the final project finished during Nov. 2021 - Dec. 2021 for class Game Theory taught by teacher Wanyuan Wang at Southeast University. 

The code is deployed on integrated Jidi website for active compete with others (my id is 'Chris'): http://www.jidiai.cn/env_detail?envid=3

The rank remained at the first place for some time and is still ranked the third place till now.

Gobang is a pure strategy board game in which two players play against each other. The board and Go are common. Both sides of the game use black and white chess pieces and place them on the intersection of the straight and horizontal lines of the chessboard. The first to form a line of five pieces wins. Considering that our team members all love and understand gobang, and considering the evaluation requirements given by the website, we chose to use the method based on gobang rules to write gobang. The rule focuses on several situations that may be encountered in a chess game and can decide whether to win or not to a certain extent, and assigns different weights to each situation. We analyzed and studied the overall structure of the game based on the relevant open source code of the Jidi website, and embedded our Gobang rules in accordance with the requirements of the Jidi website. Our model got the top ranking after uploading.
